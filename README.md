        (c) S= x^3 - x^3/3 + x^3/9 - x^3/27 + x^3/81 - x^3/243 . . . . . . (Input X,N).
Prog6: Write a Program to implement Binary Search using a recursive function.
Prog7: Write a Program to reverse an array using a recursive function.
Prog8: Write a Program to calculate the length of the string using a recursive function.

Assignment 4: Queue
Prog1: Write a program to implement a Queue class (use a list to store the elements of the Queue). [Implement Queue Overflow and Underflow by Exception]. Write a method to check two Queue are carrying similar elements or not. (Repetition of the elements are not consider)
Prog2: Write a menu driven program to implement a circular queue (use an array to store the elements of the queue). You can follow any one of the schemes A circular list with front and rear indices and one position left vacant. Or, A circular list with front and rear indices and an integer variable counting entries
Prog3: Write a menu driven program to implement a deque using list. Call the two ends of the deque left and right and write four C functions, remvLeft, remvRight, insrtLeft, insrtRight to remove and insert elements at the left and right ends of the deque. Make sure that the routines work properly for empty deque and that they detect overflow and underflow

Assignment 5: Linked list
1. Singly Linked List
Prog1: Write a menu driven program to implement a singly linked list with the following operations
        a. Insert an element at any position (front, end or intermediate)
        b. Delete an element from any position (front, end or intermediate)
        c. Display the list
        d. Perform a linear search on the list
        e. Insert an element after a specified element
        f. Delete a specified element
        g. Count the number of nodes
        h. Reverse the list, so that the last element becomes the first, and so on
        i. Concatenate two lists
   
2. Doubly and Circular Linked List
Prog2: Write a menu driven program to implement a doubly linked list with the following operations
        a. Insert an element at any position (front, end or intermediate)
        b. Delete an element from any position (front, end or intermediate)
        c. Display the list
Prog3: Write a menu driven program to implement a doubly circular linked list with the following operations
        a. Insert an element at any position (front, end or intermediate)
        b. Delete an element from any position (front, end or intermediate)
        c. Display the list
   
3. Linked List Applications (Implement the Questions by your own Linked List class)
Prog4: Write a program to implement a stack using linked list, such that the operations ‘push’ and ‘pop’ are performed in constant time.
Prog5: Write a program to implement a queue using linked list, such that the operations ‘enqueue’ and ‘dequeue’ are performed in constant time.
Prog6: Write a menu driven program to implement a double ended queue using linked list.
